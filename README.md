# Economic-Tweak
Changes Introduced by ET:

Debt Scaling:
Debt will now scale to around 120% of GDP.

Wage Changes:
Wages will now get lowed less, while being raised more.

Trade Emphasis:
Trade becomes more crucial, and a 100% debuff is applied in the event of a severe goods shortage, potentially leading to global recessions.

Private Sector Reinvestment:
In the base game, private sector reinvestment faced debuffs starting at 10 million or 100 million GDP. With ET's changes, these debuffs are gone.

Gold Reserve Income:
The cap on gold reserve income is gone. Additionally, the reverse cap is now scaled to GDP, similar to the debt scaling.
